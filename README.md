# tango_gl
Forked from Google samples to offer more for your Tango Graphic needs

This repo is because the only source of info for developing Project Tango via the C API (Android NDK) is from the [Google Sample Repo](https://github.com/googlesamples/tango-examples-c)

They included this nice little wrapper around OpenGL to help take care of some of work with how hook the Tango screen to the OpenGL window, but there is a HUGE lack of documentation anywhere and also it would be nice to have more features for it... this is where this repo comes in!
